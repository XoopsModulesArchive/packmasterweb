<H2>About Pack Master Web 
</H2>
<P>The Pack Master Web module works with Xoops version 2.07.  I built
this module because the Cub Scout Pack that my son is a member of
uses Pack Master Software from <A HREF="http://www.troopmaster.com/index.html">Troopmaster
Software, Inc</A>.  Pack Master allows a Cub Scout Pack to track the
advancement of the Cub Scouts and the adult leaders.  It also creates
some interesting reports.  Pack Master is a Windows program an while
there are add-ons to allow for sharing of the data files.  I started
making a web site for our pack.  I used <A HREF="http://xoops.org/">Xoops</A>
to setup the web site.  As the pack leadership discussed what we
wanted on the site, we decided that it would be nice if the boys and
their parents could verify that we have recorded their progress
towards their ranks.  Pack Master Web was born.  The initial plan was
to allow us to upload CSV (Comma <SPAN LANG="en-US">Separated</SPAN>
Variable) files exported from Pack Master into the Pack Master Web
module.  Later development may include data entry so the whole
process can be done on our web site.</P>

<H2>Using Pack Master Web 
</H2>
<P>Pack Master Web is easy to use.  Currently the only user feature
is a block that displays a drop down list of Cub Scouts.  The user
selects the Cub Scout that they want to check the advancement for and
then click on that advancement tab they want to check <B><I>Tiger</I></B>,
<B><I>Bobcat</I></B>, <B><I>Wolf</I></B>, <B><I>Bear</I></B>, <B><I>Webelos</I></B>
etc.  Thats is for now.</P>
